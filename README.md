# BOMAWI Strategy

This is a forex trading strategy coded in MQL4 that utilizes Bollinger
Bands, MACD, and William's Percent Range (WPR) indicators to identify
potential trade opportunities.

## Strategy Parameters

The strategy has the following parameters that can be customized:

-   `riskPerTrade` - determines the percentage of the account balance to
    risk per trade.
-   `bbPeriod`, `bandStdEntry`, `bandStdProfitExit`, `bandStdLossExit` -
    parameters for the Bollinger Bands indicator.
-   `macd_fast`, `macd_slow`, `macd_signal` - parameters for the MACD
    indicator.
-   `willPeriod`, `willLowerLevel`, `willUpperLevel` - parameters for
    the William's Percent Range indicator.

## Trading Rules

The strategy enters a long position if the following conditions are
met: - the current Ask price is below the lower Bollinger Band; - the
previous candle's open price is above the lower Bollinger Band; - the
current William's Percent Range value is lower than `willLowerLevel`; -
the MACD main line is negative.

The strategy enters a short position if the following conditions are
met: - the current Bid price is above the upper Bollinger Band; - the
previous candle's open price is below the upper Bollinger Band; - the
current William's Percent Range value is higher than `willUpperLevel`; -
the MACD main line is positive.

The strategy places a buy limit order at the lower Bollinger Band with
the stop loss at the lower Bollinger Band minus `bandStdLossExit`
standard deviations and the take profit at the upper Bollinger Band plus
`bandStdProfitExit` standard deviations. The lot size is determined
based on the `riskPerTrade` parameter.

The strategy places a sell limit order at the upper Bollinger Band with
the stop loss at the upper Bollinger Band plus `bandStdLossExit`
standard deviations and the take profit at the lower Bollinger Band
minus `bandStdProfitExit` standard deviations. The lot size is
determined based on the `riskPerTrade` parameter.

## Usage

This strategy can be used on any forex pair and timeframe, but it is
recommended to use it on a higher timeframe (such as H1 or above) to
reduce the number of false signals.

To use this strategy, copy the `BOMAWI Strategy.mq4` file into your
MetaTrader 4 indicators folder
(e.g.Â `C:\Program Files (x86)\MetaTrader 4\experts\indicators`). Then,
compile the file in MetaEditor and attach the compiled indicator to the
chart of your desired currency pair and timeframe. Set the parameters as
desired and start trading.
